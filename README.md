# Shopping cart

Tested on Firefox and Chromium.

## Running the code

To run the code:

    chromium index.html

OR

To build and run the code (requires Node.js and npm):

    npm start
    chromium http://localhost:8080/

I am not saving the state of the shopping cart for the React task so it loses
the cart state on refresh.
